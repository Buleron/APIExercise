# Goal
The goal of this exercise is for a Backend Engineer to exercise all the concepts, tools and technologies explained at the parent page (BackEnd Engineering).

## Introduction
In order to enable a Prime engineer to fully expand his/her capabilities in terms of technologies and tools for Front End Engineering he/she will start this exercise and follow it thoroughly to completion. During this assignment the assignee will have to:

Start his/her own project
Configure the required external libraries and tools
Configure Webpack bundling
Setup a Play App, which has:
Controllers (for endpoint handling)
Services (for data access on specific features)
Akka cluster (for pub/sub implementation in a distributed cluster)
Develop good clean code, according to our coding styles and guidelines
Provide documentation
Provide test cases and ensure the app is change proof!

# Requirements
For this assignment, we will try to setup a fictive scenario for which all of the concepts will be covered. We call our assignment "Dashboards Platform".

The Backend API will have all the capabilities to support the Front End Engineering Exercise.
